 
 # I/O Abstraction
 - Software doesn't need to know what it's communicating with (I/O) as long as it follows a certain set of rules.
 - I/O streams are the transfer of data from a source to a destination. 
 - I/O streams require the closing of resources and handling of appropriate exceptions.
 - These examples utilise Java 7's try-with-resources and implement the AutoClosable interface, which automatically calls close() at runtime.

 # Reading input from the Console
- The basic input stream of System.in doesn't provide a helpful way to access user input as it exposes data received as bytes.
- Scanner resides in a utility class, which has methods to help manipulate the textual data using tokenization (breaking into a collection of smaller strings) by default the input data is separated by white space, newlines, spaces & tabs.

```Java
    try (Scanner S = new Scanner(System.in)) {
            String name, secondName;
            System.out.println("Enter first name:");
            name = S.nextLine();
            System.out.println("Enter second name:");
            secondName = S.nextLine();
            System.out.printf("Hello %s %s ", name, secondName);
        }
```
# Creating Files
```Java
 String fileName = "example.txt";
        try (FileReader reader = new FileReader(fileName); Scanner SCAN = new Scanner(reader)){
            String fileData = SCAN.nextLine();
            System.out.printf(fileData);
        }
        catch(IOException e){
            System.out.printf("An unexpected error occurred");
        } 
```

# Deleting Files
```JAVA
File f = new File("test.txt");
        String fileName = f.getName();
        if (f.exists()){
            boolean deleted = f.delete();
            if (deleted) 
            System.out.printf("%s deleted", fileName);
            else 
            System.out.println("Failed to delete " + fileName);
        }
        else
            System.out.printf("%s doesn't exist", fileName);
```

# Reading input from file
- FileReader provides file-specific functionality, however shares the same data stream reader abstraction as System.in, this means utilization of the scanner class is also required to deal with the textual data.
- Must be aware of the structure of the file contents to appropriately read.
- Default location of the file will depend on execution environment.
```Java
   String fileName = "example.txt";
        //can declare more than one class in try-with-resources but they are closed in reverse order
        try (FileReader reader = new FileReader(fileName); Scanner SCAN = new Scanner(reader)){
            String data = SCAN.nextLine();
            System.out.println(data);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.printf("Something unexpected occurred");
        }
 ```
 
 # Writing to files
- PrintWriter shares the same data stream writer abstraction as System.out, with the added benefits of printf methods allowing formatted text to be printed to file. 
- FileWriter is a 'lower-level' writer that only gives the ability to write strings/char arrays. 
```Java
String fileName = "example.txt";
        try (PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(fileName)){
            writer.print("hello file " + fileName);
            System.out.println("write success");
        } catch (IOException ex) {
            System.out.print("write fail");
        }
```
# Splitting Strings
- When there is a lot of modification it is better to use either StringBuilder or StringBuffer.
- StringBuffer is thread safe as its methods are synchronized.
```JAVA
 String immutableString = "The String Class is final, making String immutable. It cannot be modified, we can only change reference to the object.";
        StringBuilder fastString = new StringBuilder(
                "String Builder is newer and generally recommended due to performance. However, it does not have thread safe (synchronized) methods.");
        StringBuffer threadSafeString = new StringBuffer(
                "StringBuffer should be used if thread safety is a necessity.");

        String[] s1 = immutableString.split("\\."); // RegEx
        int indexS2 = fastString.indexOf(".") + 2;
        String s2 = fastString.substring(indexS2);
        int indexS3 = threadSafeString.indexOf(".");
        String s3 = threadSafeString.substring(indexS3);
```
# 2D Array Implementation 
- Stored as arrays of arrays
```JAVA
        int[][] cords = { { 2, 5 }, { 6, 7 } };

        // Row-Major Order : traversal occurs across rows
        for (int i = 0; i < cords[0].length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cords.length; j++) {
                System.out.println(cords[j][i]);
            }
        }
        // Column-Major Order : traversal occurs across columns
        for (int i = 0; i < cords[0].length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cords.length; j++) {
                System.out.println(cords[j][i]);
            }
        }
```

# Other Basics of Java

## Data Types & Format Specifiers
```JAVA
            // Integral
            System.out.printf("byte:   %d bit     lower range: %d    upper range: %d \n", Byte.SIZE, Byte.MIN_VALUE,
                    Byte.MAX_VALUE);
            System.out.printf("short:  %d bit     lower range: %, d    upper range: %, d \n", Short.SIZE,
                    Short.MIN_VALUE, Short.MAX_VALUE);
            System.out.printf("int:    %d bit     lower range: %, d    upper range: %, d \n", Integer.SIZE,
                    Integer.MIN_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
            System.out.printf("long:   %d bit     lower range: %, d    upper range: %, d \n", Long.SIZE, Long.MIN_VALUE,
                    Long.MAX_VALUE);
            // Floating Point
            System.out.printf("float:  %d bit     lower range: %e    upper range: %e \n", Float.SIZE, -Float.MAX_VALUE,
                    Float.MAX_VALUE);
            System.out.printf("double: %d bit     lower range: %e    upper range: %e \n", Double.SIZE, Double.MIN_VALUE,
                    Double.MAX_VALUE);
            // Character
            System.out.printf("char:    %d bit     lower range: %d    upper range:%, d \n", Character.SIZE,
                    (int) Character.MIN_VALUE, (int) Character.MAX_VALUE);
            // Boolean
            System.out.printf("boolean: %d bit     %b or %b \n", 1, Boolean.TRUE, Boolean.FALSE);
            // Reference
            MyClass objectInstance = new MyClass();
