 
 # I/O Abstraction
 - Software doesn't need to know what it's communicating with (I/O) as long as it follows a certain set of rules.
 - I/O streams are the transfer of data from a source to a destination. 

 # Reading input from the Console
- The basic input stream of System.in doesn't provide a helpful way to access user input as it exposes data received as bytes.
- Scanner resides in a utility class, which has methods to help manipulate the textual data using tokenization (breaking into a collection of smaller strings) by default the input data is separated by white space, newlines, spaces & tabs.

```Java
    Scanner S = new Scanner(System.in); 
    String name, secondName; 
    System.out.println("Enter first name:");
    name = S.nextLine();
    System.out.println("Enter second name:");
    secondName = S.nextLine();
    System.out.printf("Hello %s %s ",name, secondName);
```
# Creating Files
```Java
File f = new File("test.txt");
        try {
            f.createNewFile();
            if(f.exists()){
                System.out.println("Created file " + f.getName());
            }
            else
            System.out.println("A file with that name already exists");

        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("An error occurred while trying to create the file " + f.getName());
        }
```

# Deleting Files

# Reading input from file
- FileReader provides file-specific functionality, however shares the same data stream reader abstraction as System.in, this means utilization of the scanner class is also required to deal with the textual data.
- Must be aware of the structure of the file contents to appropriately read.
- Default location of the file will depend on execution environment.
```Java
   String FILENAME = "example.txt"; 
    FileReader reader;
    try {
        reader = new FileReader(FILENAME);
        Scanner SCAN = new Scanner(reader);
        SCAN.nextLine();
        SCAN.close();
    } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
        System.out.printf("Specified path name %s doesn't exist", FILENAME);
    }
 ```
 
 # Writing to files
- PrintWriter shares the same data stream writer abstraction as System.out, with the added benefits of printf methods allowing formatted text to be printed to file. 
- FileWriter is a 'lower-level' writer that only gives the ability to write strings/char arrays. 
```Java
String FILENAME = "example.txt";
        try {
            PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(FILENAME);
            writer.print("hello file " + FILENAME);
            System.out.println("write success");
            writer.close();
        } catch (IOException ex) {
            System.out.print("write fail");
        }

```
