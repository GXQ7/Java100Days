 
 # I/O Abstraction
 - Software doesn't need to know what it's communicating with (I/O) as long as it follows a certain set of rules.
 - I/O streams are the transfer of data from a source to a destination. input device -> software & sofware -> output device

 # Reading input from the Console
- The basic input stream of System.in doesn't provide a helpful way to access user input as it exposes data recieved as bytes.
- Scanner resides in a utility class, which has methods to help manipulate the textual data using tokenisation (breaking into a colection of smaller strings) by default the input data is seperated by white space, newlines, spaces & tabs.

```Java
    Scanner S = new Scanner(System.in); 
    String name, secondName; 
    System.out.println("Enter first name:");
    name = S.nextLine();
    System.out.println("Enter second name:");
    secondName = S.nextLine();
    System.out.printf("Hello %s %s ",name, secondName);
```
 
# Reading input from file
- FileReader provides file-specific functionality, however shares the same data stream reader abstraction as System.in, this means utilisation of the scanner class is also requried to deal with the textual data.
- Must be aware of the structure of the file contents to appropriately read.
- Default location of the file will depend on execution environment.
```Java
   String FILENAME = "example.txt"; 
    FileReader reader;
    try {
        reader = new FileReader(FILENAME);
        Scanner SCAN = new Scanner(reader);
        SCAN.nextLine();
        SCAN.close();
    } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
        System.out.printf("Specified path name %s doesn't exist", FILENAME);
    }
 ```
