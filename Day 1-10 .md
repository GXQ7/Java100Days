 ## Reading input from the Console
- The basic input stream of System.in doesn't provide a helpful way to access user input.
- Scanner resides in a utility class, which can be used to manipulate the text data using tokenisation (breaking into a colection of smaller strings) by default the input data is seperated by white space, newlines, spaces, tabs.

```Java
    Scanner S = new Scanner(System.in); 
    String name, secondName; 
    System.out.println("Enter first name:");
    name = S.nextLine();
    System.out.println("Enter second name:");
    secondName = S.nextLine();
    System.out.printf("Hello %s %s ",name, secondName);
```
