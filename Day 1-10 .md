 ## Reading input from the Console
- The basic input stream of System.in doesn't provide a helpful way to access user input.
- Scanner resides in a utility class, which can be used to manipulate the text data using tokenisation (breaking into a colection of smaller strings) by default the input data is seperated by white space, newlines, spaces & tabs.

```Java
    Scanner S = new Scanner(System.in); 
    String name, secondName; 
    System.out.println("Enter first name:");
    name = S.nextLine();
    System.out.println("Enter second name:");
    secondName = S.nextLine();
    System.out.printf("Hello %s %s ",name, secondName);
```
 
# Reading input from file
- FileReader provides file-specific functionality, but shares the same data stream reader abstraction as System.in; meaning utilisation of Scanner class. 
- Must be aware of the structure of the file contents to appropriately read.
- Default location of the file will depend on execution environment - will have to add in error handling.
```Java
    String FILENAME = "C:\\example.txt"; 
    FileReader file = new FileReader("example.txt");
    Scanner SCAN = new Scanner(file);
    System.out.println(SCAN.next());
    System.out.println(SCAN.next());
    System.out.println(SCAN.nextInt());
 ```
